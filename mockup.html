<h2>Padilla Mobile Mockup</h2>
<p>
This is an early prototype intended to help structure discussion. This prototype is best viewed in <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/">Google Chrome</a>. The tool is aimed at criminal defense attorneys looking for resources regarding immigration consequences in accordance with <i>Padilla</i>. As such, the final product is intended as an interactive practice guide. It will also provide contact information for local immigration attorneys. The current logic is loosely based on <a href="https://www.publiccounsel.net/iiu/wp-content/uploads/sites/15/IIU-Guide-May-2018.pdf" target=_blank>Immigration Consequences of Massachusetts Criminal Convictions</a> and would be refined further in the development process. Similarly, listings of attorneys are incomplete, and only provided here to help flesh out a prototype aimed at structuring discussion. The webapp includes three parts:
</p>
<h3>1. Guided Interview</h3>
<p>
Users are asked a series of branching questions to help determine relevant resources and potential courses of action. 
</p>
<h3>2. Interview Summary Document</h3>
<p>
After the completion of the guided interview, users are presented with the option to 'save a summary of the interview for future reference. Currently, this takes the form of a MS Word file which the user can download. Future development may explore additional options such as the ability to email the summary. 
</p>
<h3>3. Immigration Attorney Referral</h3>
<p>
The guided interview often suggests contacting an immigration attorney. To help facilitate this process, users can explore a directory of such attorneys based on location, either as seen on a map or as part of a list.
